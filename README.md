# RARE with Agentic Retrieval Systems

A comprehensive framework combining two powerful Streamlit applications for retrieval-augmented generation: the **Enhanced RAG with Chain-of-Thought Reasoning (RARE)** system and the **Agentic Retrieval System**. Together, they offer robust document processing, intelligent retrieval, and advanced response generation capabilities powered by the Groq API.

## üåü Overview

This repository contains two complementary systems that work together to provide state-of-the-art document retrieval and question-answering capabilities:

- **RARE System**: Foundation RAG with chain-of-thought reasoning
- **Agentic Retrieval System**: Advanced multi-strategy retrieval with intelligent routing

Both systems leverage vector databases for efficient storage, semantic similarity searches, and the Groq API for generating high-quality responses.

## üß† RARE-Enhanced RAG with Chain-of-Thought Reasoning

### Overview
The RARE system is a retrieval-augmented generation application designed to provide intelligent, reasoned answers based on a knowledge base of uploaded documents. It utilizes ChromaDB for efficient storage and retrieval of document embeddings, enabling semantic similarity searches with a systematic chain-of-thought reasoning approach.

### Key Features
- **Multi-format Document Support**: Processes TXT, PDF, DOCX, CSV, JSON, and Excel files
- **Vector Database**: Uses ChromaDB for persistent storage and fast retrieval of document embeddings
- **Semantic Search**: Retrieves documents based on cosine similarity of embeddings
- **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning**: Generates structured responses with a 6-step reasoning process
- **Persistent Knowledge Base**: Retains documents across sessions
- **User Interface**: Streamlit-based interface for document management and querying

### How RARE Works

1. **Document Upload**: Users upload files or manually add text
2. **Text Extraction**: Extracts content from supported file formats
3. **Embedding Generation**: Creates embeddings using the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` SentenceTransformer model
4. **Storage**: Stores embeddings and metadata in ChromaDB
5. **Querying**: Retrieves top-k relevant documents based on query embedding similarity
6. **Response Generation**: Constructs a chain-of-thought prompt with retrieved documents and generates a response via the Groq API

### Chain-of-Thought Process
1. **Understanding**: Analyze and restate the user's question
2. **Context Analysis**: Examine retrieved documents for relevance
3. **Reasoning Process**: Break down complex questions step-by-step
4. **Evidence Synthesis**: Combine information from multiple sources
5. **Conclusion Formation**: Provide well-reasoned answers
6. **Verification**: Double-check answer consistency and completeness

### Usage - RARE System
- **Upload Documents**: Add files via the uploader (supports multiple formats)
- **Add Manually**: Input text and sources directly
- **Clear Knowledge Base**: Remove all stored documents
- **Ask Questions**: Query the system to receive reasoned responses

## ü§ñ Agentic Retrieval System

### Overview
The Agentic Retrieval System builds upon the retrieval-augmented generation concept by introducing advanced, agentic retrieval strategies. It supports multiple knowledge bases and dynamically selects the best retrieval mode for a query, offering more flexible and intelligent retrieval capabilities than traditional RAG systems.

### Key Features
- **Multiple Knowledge Bases**: Organize documents into distinct knowledge bases with descriptions
- **Intelligent Routing**: Routes queries to the most relevant knowledge base(s) using the Groq API
- **Dynamic Retrieval Modes**: Supports multiple retrieval strategies:
  - `chunks`: Retrieves specific document excerpts
  - `files_via_metadata`: Retrieves files based on metadata matches
  - `files_via_content`: Retrieves files based on full content similarity
  - `web_search`: Simulates external information retrieval (mock implementation)
- **Iterative Refinement**: Adjusts retrieval strategies if initial results are insufficient
- **Response Generation**: Generates answers from retrieved context using the Groq API
- **Supported Formats**: Handles PDF, DOCX, and TXT files

### How Agentic Retrieval Works

1. **Knowledge Base Management**: Create or select knowledge bases and upload documents
2. **Document Processing**: Extracts text, creates chunks, and generates embeddings
3. **Query Routing**: Identifies relevant knowledge bases for the query
4. **Mode Selection**: Determines the optimal retrieval mode (e.g., chunks, files_via_content)
5. **Retrieval**: Executes retrieval based on the selected mode
6. **Result Evaluation**: Assesses result sufficiency, refining with alternative modes if needed
7. **Response Generation**: Combines retrieved context into a coherent answer via the Groq API

### Usage - Agentic Retrieval System
- **Create Knowledge Base**: Define a new knowledge base with a name and description
- **Upload Documents**: Add files to a selected knowledge base
- **Query the System**: Enter a query to retrieve information and generate a response
- **View Knowledge Bases**: Inspect and manage existing knowledge bases
